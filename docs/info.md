## How it works

This is a simple digital circuit that was designed beginning November 7, 2024 with TinyTapeout and UCSD in La Jolla.  I was updated to add a flip-flop but it is next yet complete.

In the next phase of the design, I added a configured two flip flops and made a clock divider.

## How to test

The test process is very simple and will be provided later.

## External hardware

A logic analyzer is helpful as this design evolves.
